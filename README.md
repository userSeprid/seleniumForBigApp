# Automatic test for web application via Selenium web driver.
This is the big project that i was participated on non-commercial base. 

My role was:
- Create test cases.
- Implement tests via Selenium web driver.
- Test optimization.
- Bugs review. (Fixing only if the case in test part)

This is a part of project that i worked on. Repository also holds other people code that why i strongly highlight fact that my code only in 'test' directory and it subdirectories.
